Data Cleaning:
Checked for missing values (e.g., missing revenue, occupancy rate, or guest details).
Removed duplicate entries to prevent skewed insights.
Standardized date formats for consistency.
Validated categorical data (e.g., ensuring consistent country names).
Data Structuring:
Created relevant metrics and dimensions such as:
Total revenue per guest
Occupancy rate per month
Booking and cancellation trends
Guest country contribution
Seasonal performance comparison
ðŸ“Œ Output of Pre-Analysis:
A clean and structured dataset with all necessary variables.
Ready for detailed exploration and visualization.
IN-ANALYSIS (Exploratory Data Analysis & Trend Identification)

ðŸ“Œ Output of In-Analysis:
Identified trends and seasonality patterns.
Found key revenue-driving factors.
Highlighted challenges (e.g., cancellations, low seasonal performance).
